# Photo-Z Challenge: Environment Setup and Execution Guide

Welcome to the Photo-Z Challenge! This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up your Python environment, install all required dependencies, and run the machine learning pipeline on your local machine (compatible with both Windows and macOS).

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

* **Git:** To download the repository.
* **Miniconda (Recommended) or Anaconda:** This is the most reliable way to manage Python environments and complex libraries (like PyTorch and PyTables) across different operating systems. Download it from the [official Anaconda website](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/).
